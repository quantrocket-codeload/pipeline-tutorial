    "Sometimes we want to ignore certain assets when computing pipeline expresssions. There are two common cases where ignoring assets is useful:\n",
    "1. We want to compute an expression that's computationally expensive, and we know we only care about results for certain assets. An example of such an expensive expression is a `Factor` computing the coefficients of a regression ([RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns](https://www.quantrocket.com/docs/api/#zipline.pipeline.factors.RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns)).\n",
    "2. We want to compute an expression that performs comparisons between assets, but we only want those comparisons to be performed against a subset of all assets. For example, we might want to use the `Factor` method `top` to compute the top 200 assets by earnings yield, ignoring assets that don't meet some liquidity constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these two use-cases, all `Factors` and many `Factor` methods can accept a mask argument, which must be a `Filter` indicating which assets to consider when computing."
