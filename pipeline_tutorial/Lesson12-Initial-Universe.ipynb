    "By default, a pipeline performs computations on every asset in the bundle. As we learned in an earlier lesson, an optional `screen` argument (consisting of a Filter) can be applied that limits the pipeline output to a subset of assets. Under the hood, screens are applied as the last step of a pipeline computation. If we screen for assets with dollar volume above $1MM, the pipeline will compute dollar volume for every asset in the bundle, then filter out any asset/date combinations where dollar volume falls below the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we are often performing computations on assets that don't ultimately interest us. Often, this extra computational work is necessary because we don't know in advance which assets will pass the screen. We don't know which assets have high dollar volume until we compute dollar volume for all assets. However, sometimes we do know in advance that certain assets can be excluded. If we are screening for certain kinds of stocks but our bundle includes stocks and ETFs, does it make sense to perform computations on the ETFs? Wouldn't it be better to exclude the ETFs entirely?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to exclude ETFs would be to use masking. We could create a filter that returns `False` for ETFs and pass that filter as the `mask` argument to any factors we want to use. However, a better approach in this case is to exclude ETFs from the initial universe that our pipeline considers. This can be done with the `initial_universe` parameter to the `Pipeline` class:"

Since `screen` supports any filter while `initial_universe` only supports a limited set of filters, we could rely entirely on `screen` if we didn't care about speed. But since we care about speed, a general rule of thumb is to use `initial_universe` when possible and use `screen` for filters that `initial_universe` doesn't support.\n",

The speed benefit is greater, the fewer assets we are interested in. Suppose we want to get the rolling linear regression of two assets, Apple and Microsoft, versus SPY, using the built-in `RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns` factor. (This factor is computationally expensive and thus a good choice for this demonstration, but we will omit discussion of its parameters and multiple outputs; see the factor's docstring if you want to learn more about it.)"
