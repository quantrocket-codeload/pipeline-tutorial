    "Now that we've covered the basic components of the Pipeline API, let's construct a pipeline that we might want to use in an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will create a filter to narrow down the full universe of US stocks to a subset of tradable securities, defined as those securities that meet all of the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common stocks only: no preferred stocks, ADRs, limited partnerships (LPs), or ETFs. ADRs are issuances in the US equity market for stocks that trade on other exchanges. Frequently, there is inherent risk associated with depositary receipts due to currency fluctuations so we exclude them from our pipeline. LP securities are not tradable with most brokers, so we exclude them as well. In the case of the US Stock dataset, selecting for \"Common Stock\" in the `usstock_SecurityType2` field will automatically exclude preferred stocks, ETFs, ADRs, and LPs, as the latter all have different values for `usstock_SecurityType2`.\n",
    "- Primary shares only: for companies with multiple share classes, select only the primary share class \n",
    "- Dollar volume: to ensure that stocks in our universe are relatively easy to trade when entering and exiting positions, include only stocks that have average daily dollar volume of \\$2.5M or more over the trailing 200 days.\n",
    "- Not too cheap: if a stock's price is lower than \\$5, the bid-ask spread becomes larger relative to the price, and the transaction cost becomes too high. \n",
    "- 200 continuous days of price and volume: If a stock has any missing data for the previous 200 days, the company is excluded. This targets stocks with trading halts, IPOs, and other situations that make them harder to assess.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Former Quantopian users may notice that this universe is modeled on Quantopian's most popular universe, `QTradableStocksUS`, described in [this archived Quantopian forum post](https://quantopian-archive.netlify.app/forum/threads/working-on-our-best-universe-yet-qtradablestocksus.html). To reduce data dependencies, we have omitted one rule, namely that market cap must be over \\$500M. See the note further down if you have a Sharadar fundamentals subscription and would like to add this market cap filter.\n"
